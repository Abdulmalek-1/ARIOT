## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our final year project on Device Automation using Augmented Reality (AR) and Internet of Things (IoT). This project aims to explore the fusion of AR and IoT to enhance user experiences in device automation.

These days, Device Automation through IoT has become an essential component, and its reach can be expanded to encompass Augmented Reality. Augmented Reality is employed to overlay interactive content onto real-world objects, facilitating the placement of 3D objects for the control of various IoT devices. Our project investigates the fusion of Augmented Reality (AR) with IoT-based Device Automation. It focuses on using AR to overlay interactive elements onto real-world objects, enabling IoT device control through 3D objects.

## Results
Based on our findings, we have demonstrated that the integration of AR enhances user control and engagement. Users can interact with 3D device representations, simplifying smart device management. This integration offers potential benefits such as improved user satisfaction and efficient device control, paving the way for a more accessible user experience.

## Circuit Diagram and Implementation Code
We have included a circuit diagram in the repository to provide an overview of the hardware setup used for the project. Please refer to the relevant files for further details.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our project explores the fusion of Augmented Reality and IoT in the context of device automation. We are driven by the desire to enhance user experiences and redefine how we interact with and manage IoT devices.

The findings from our project underscore the potential benefits of integrating AR and IoT, including improved user satisfaction and more efficient device control. We believe that this fusion has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and open new possibilities for future applications.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and please feel free to explore the repository for more information and resources.
